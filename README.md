This notebook is a hands-on workshop designed to introduce users to the Google Gemini API. It covers the following key concepts and functionalities:

Authentication: Demonstrates how to securely set up and use your Gemini API key, recommending Colab Secrets for Google Colab users.
Installing the SDK: Provides instructions for installing the necessary Python SDK for interacting with the Gemini API.
Configuring the SDK: Shows how to configure the SDK using your API key retrieved from Colab Secrets.
Running your first prompt: Guides users on how to send basic text prompts to a Gemini model and retrieve the response.
Using images in your prompt: Explains how to include image data in prompts for multimodal interactions.
Uploading files: Covers uploading various file types (PDF, text, code, etc.) to Gemini for processing.
Supplying a schema: Demonstrates how to constrain the model's output to a specific JSON schema using Pydantic models.
Using an enum to constrain output: Shows how to use Python enums to limit the model's response to a predefined set of values.
Having a chat: Introduces the concept of multi-turn conversations using the ChatSession class and how to access chat history.
Setting the system instruction: Explains how to use system instructions to guide the model's behavior and response style.
Exercise 1: A Simple Story Generator with Gemini Chat API: A practical exercise to build an interactive story generator using the chat functionality, theme selection, and action choices.
Function calling: Introduces the function calling feature, allowing the model to invoke external functions based on user prompts.
Using Model Context Protocol (MCP): Briefly explains MCP and its role in connecting AI applications with external tools and data sources.
Exercise 2: A Weather App using Function Calling: A practical exercise to build a weather application by integrating with a weather API using Gemini's function calling capability.
Using Code Execution: Demonstrates how Gemini can generate and execute Python code to perform calculations or other tasks.
Prompt Caching: Explains the concept of prompt caching to optimize token usage and cost for repetitive prompts.
URL Context: Shows how to provide Gemini with URLs as context to allow the model to retrieve information from web pages.
Exercise 3: An Assessment Generator for School Teachers: A more complex exercise that challenges users to build an assessment generator using file uploads, URL context, and code execution.
The notebook provides code examples and explanations for each concept, culminating in practical exercises to reinforce the learning. It's designed to help users become familiar with Gemini's API and its various features for building simple to more complex applications.
